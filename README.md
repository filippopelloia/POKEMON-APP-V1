### This is a simple Pokedex made with React.js:
This app includes a lot of data about Pokemon such as:
1. Number in the National Pokedex.
2. Name.
3. Type or Types (such as Fire, Grass, Dark..).
4. Region of appartenence.
5. Front image (normal and shiny version)
6. Which creature is a Legendary Pokemon.

***

* I created this app in React.
* I used Axios and this API: https://pokeapi.co/ to get all the data.
